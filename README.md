# Mehfooz - An Emergency Response Network for a Smart Society

### Mehfooz is a robust scalable network of emergency responders. Any citizen can tap into the network to avail services in one or more ways. This has been done to democratize the network so that citizens have free and equal access to emergency services. Mehfooz is an approach to build a healthy ecosystem wherein citizens do not hesitate to ask for help.

Mehfooz is not just another app or wearable but we plan on building an entire platform as a SaaS solution for the emergency response institutions viz. Police, Hospitals and Fire Department in a city. The Mehfooz Platform is made up of several modules.

1. Mehfooz Responder App - Every responder on-duty is seamlessly on the Mehfooz network through a smartphone app that broadcasts his current location to the Mehfooz network and tracks his assignments and updates (if any). The responder can also call upon enforcements and send updates about a particular situation to his peers.
2. Mehfooz Drishyam - The Mehfooz Drishyam is an intelligent service that serves as a backend for the Mehfooz platform. It receives the geo-tagged distress signals and situation updates from citizens and well as other responders and intelligently assigns them as tasks to the nearby responders available on duty.
3. Mehfooz Citizen Services - Citizens can tap into the Mehfooz network in several ways. As mentioned before, this has been done to democratize the service so that there is a guarantee for free and equal access to all citizens. Each application in the citizen services
   1. Mehfooz Citizen App - One of the ways is a Mehfooz Citizen App that users can install on their smartphones. The App will be designed to work without the internet in the worst case so that geo-tagged citizen distress signals can reach the Mehfooz Drihsyam in every situation.
   2. Mehfooz Saathi - Mehfooz Saathi is a low-cost self-powered wearable design that functions independent of the internet unlike any other. We have designed a 3D CAD model our product. It is low cost smartwatch design which will have two buttons as its primary features. One will be for Law and order distress and the other one will be for health distress. The device operates standalone which means it does not need to be connected to a smartphone. This is done keeping in mind the lack of 4G/3G coverage and Smartphone penetration in smaller towns in the country. The device transmits a geo-tagged citizen distress signal to the Mehfooz Drishyam upon a trigger.
   3. Mehfooz Helpline - Mehfooz Helpline is a toll-free service where citizens can talk to service executives and lodge a distress signal with their location on to Mehfooz Drishyam. This is done keeping in mind that not everyone can afford a smartphone for the Mehfooz Citizen App or the Mehfooz Saathi. The Mehfooz Helpline will enable anyone with access to a phone to tap into the Mehfooz Network.
4. Mehfooz Education - Mehfooz aims to design a series of workshops aimed to be conducted in collaboration with schools and workplaces focussed on stimuli to crime and coping mechanisms so we shed off the fears that stop us from reporting crimes and being just a bystander to happening crimes.
