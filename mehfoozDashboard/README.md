## Features

- Bootstrapped with Create React App, the same tooling works out-of-the-box
- Scaffolding incorporates Google Material Design principles through Material-UI
- Built on top of Firebase with Analytics, Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Functions, Storage and Performance Monitoring working from the start
- Robust routing with React Router including error handling
- Extensive mobile support with full-screen dialogs and [react-swipeable-views](https://react-swipeable-views.com) for tabs

## Demo

The demo is using the `master` branch, which houses the latest version of the template.

https://mehfooz-dashboard.web.app/

## Get started

The project is up and running after just 4 commands.

### Clone the repository

The command `git clone` is a [Git](https://www.git-scm.com) command-line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository.
The `<directory>` option is the name of a new directory to clone into, replace it with your project’s name.
The “humanish” part of the source repository is used if no directory is explicitly given (`repo` for `/path/to/repo.git` and `foo` for `host.xz:foo/.git`).

```
git clone https://github.com/ajwad-shaikh/MehfoozNetwork.git <directory>
```

### Install the dependencies

The command `cd`, also known as `chdir` (**ch**ange **dir**ectory), is a command-line OS shell command used to change the current working directory.
The `<directory>` option is the name of the new working directory, replace it with your project’s name.

```
cd <directory>
```

The command `yarn install` is a [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) command-line utility which is used to install all dependencies for a project.
This is most commonly used when you have just checked out code for a project, or when another developer on the project has added a new dependency that you need to pick up.

```
yarn install
```

### Run the app

The command `yarn start` is another Yarn command-line utility which is used to run the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

```
yarn start
```

### Create a Firebase project

1. In the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com), click **Add project**, then select or enter a **Project name**.
If you have an existing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project, you can select the project from the dropdown menu to add Firebase resources to that project.
2. *(Optional)* If you created a new project, you can edit the **Project ID**.
Firebase automatically assigns a unique ID to your Firebase project.
Visit [Understand Firebase Projects](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/learn-more#project-id) to learn about how Firebase uses the project ID.
3. Click **Continue**.
4. *(Optional)* Set up Google Analytics for your project.
When prompted, select to use an existing [Google Analytics account](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009618?ref_topic=3544906&authuser=0) or to create a new account.
If you choose to create a new account, select your [Analytics reporting location](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations), then accept the data sharing settings and Google Analytics terms for your project.
5. Click **Create project** (or **Add Firebase**, if you’re using an existing GCP project).

### Create a Cloud Firestore database

1. From the console’s navigation pane, select **Database**, then click **Create database** for Cloud Firestore.
2. Select a starting mode for your Cloud Firestore Security Rules.
**Test mode** is good for getting started with the mobile and web client libraries, but allows anyone to read and overwrite your data.
After testing, **make sure to review the [Secure your data](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#secure_your_data) section**.
**Locked mode** denies all reads and writes from mobile and web clients.
Your authenticated application servers (C#, Go, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, or Ruby) can still access your database.
To get started with the C#, Go, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, or Ruby server client library, select locked mode.
3. Select a [location](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/locations#types) for your database.
This location setting is your project’s [default Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resource location](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/locations#default-cloud-location).
Note that this location will be used for GCP services in your project that require a location setting, specifically, your default [Cloud Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage) bucket and your [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs) app (which is required if you use Cloud Scheduler).
If you aren’t able to select a location, then your project already has a default GCP resource location.
It was set either during project creation or when setting up another service that requires a location setting.
4. Click **Done**.

### Deploy Cloud Firestore Security Rules

1. Open the [**Rules** tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/database/firestore/rules) in the Cloud Firestore section of the Firebase console.
2. Copy the contents of the `firestore.rules` file in your project and paste it into the online editor.
3. Click **Publish**.

### Create a default Storage bucket

1. From the navigation pane of the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com), select **Storage**, then click **Get started**.
2. Review the messaging about securing your Storage data using security rules.
During development, consider [setting up your rules for public access](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/start#set_up_public_access).
3. Select a [location](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations#types) for your default Storage bucket.
This location setting is your project’s [default Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resource location](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/locations#default-cloud-location).
Note that this location will be used for GCP services in your project that require a location setting, specifically, your [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) database and your [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs) app (which is required if you use Cloud Scheduler).
If you aren’t able to select a location, then your project already has a default GCP resource location.
It was set either during project creation or when setting up another service that requires a location setting.
If you’re on the Blaze plan, you can [create multiple buckets](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/start#use_multiple_storage_buckets), each with its own [location](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-locations).
4. Click **Done**.

### Deploy Storage Security Rules

1. Open the [**Rules** tab](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/storage/rules) in the Storage section of the Firebase console.
2. Copy the contents of the `storage.rules` file in your project and paste it into the online editor.
3. Click **Publish**.

### Register your app with Firebase

1. In the center of the [Firebase console’s project overview page](https://console.firebase.google.com), click the **Web** icon to launch the setup workflow.
If you’ve already added an app to your Firebase project, click **Add app** to display the platform options.
2. Enter your app’s nickname.
This nickname is an internal, convenience identifier and is only visible to you in the Firebase console.
3. *(Optional)* Set up Firebase Hosting for your web app.
You can set up Firebase Hosting now or [later](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart).
You can also link your Firebase Web App to a Hosting site at any time in your [Project settings](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/general).
If you choose to set up Hosting up now, select a site from the dropdown list to link to your Firebase Web App.
This list displays your project’s default Hosting site and any [other sites](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/multisites) that you’ve set up in your project.
Any site that you’ve already linked to a Firebase Web App is unavailable for additional linking.
Each Hosting site can only be linked to a single Firebase Web App.
4. Click **Register app**.
